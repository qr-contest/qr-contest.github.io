We’ll look at each section by section. Be sure to press the Update button at the bottom to save your changes. General Options . Limit Responses (per user) - This determines how many times a voter (someone who scans the QR code) can vote. The default is Once. This will allow a person to have just one vote that counts. They can change votes by scanning another one, but that will cancel their first vote. You may also choose: . Hourly - can vote one time per hour . Daily - can vote one time per day . Once - (default) can vote one time only . No Limit - can vote as many times as they want . Question Page Header (2 lines maximum) - This text will appear at the top of the generated PDF file. It will not show on a PNG image if you choose that output option later. The text should help the voter understand what they are supposed to do. The default of Use your phone’s camera to vote. Scan, Click, Done. is an example. You may put anything you like there - but it has a maximum of 2 lines. Question Page Appearance . 1. QR Code - You may choose the internal Code Shape and foreground and background colors of the QR code that is generated for your answers. The default internal Code Shape is a square, but there are many options. Press the left and right arrow buttons to choose your code. You should be sure to try your choice out at the size you print so you can verify the code will scan. You can choose the colors of the QR code by clicking on the foreground (left box) and background (right box) color boxes. Logo - Optionally, you may add a logo that gets printed on the lower left of the generated PDF - it will not show up if you choose PNG output. You may Upload an image from your device, or you can Take Photo if your device supports it. Make sure if you alter any values in this section, you need to scroll down and press the Update button. 2. Default QR Layout for Text Answers - Currently, there is no choice here. If your answers are text-only (vs photo or photo + text), then they will print with the QR code above the text of the answer. 3. Default QR Layout for Photo Answers - The images show the layout of the QR code (shown in color) vs. the image (shown in grey). For example, the first one shows the QR code in the upper left (default) and the image behind and to the right of it. You may choose the position of the QR code by selecting one of the 6 choices. The below image shows how this is printed when you have image answers with answer text in a PDF. 4. Fit and Opacity for Photo Answers - You may choose how photos are scaled into the viewable area by selecting Cover or Contain. Cover means that the photo will comletely fill the static rectangle area of the destination (like the image above). Contain will scale the photo proportionately keeping its aspect ratio into the destination rectangle - so that you see the whole photo (below). Opacity can be controlled by moving the slider left or right. By default, the photo will completely overwrite whatever is under it. For example, on PNG files, it is possible to make the background of the screen a color (say blue) and then change the opacity of the photo so that the background ‘bleeds through’ the photo. You can play with this to see the effects it has in the varying output formats. QR Scan Response Chart Style . Select chart style - After the user scans an answer, they are redirected to a page that will show them a “Thank You” page, a pie chart or a gradient chart. The “Thank You” page will not display any results. Both of the other chart types will display the results of prior votes and the current user’s vote. You may pick which type of page is displayed here (pie or gradient). ",

Plan Notifications Currently, the only notification setting is Notify Me of Response Limits via Email. The default is ‘on’. When you purchase a Contest, there is a pre-defined number of responses (votes) and a timeframe associated with the Contest. If you are getting more responses than you thought, you will get an email notification letting you know that you have run out of responses (number left is 0). You can increase your limit by going to the Pay and Launch section of the Contest Detail page. Below is a sample where a new Answer was added and a Purchase Extension was chosen to add 5,000 responses and 2 more months. In addition, you will get notifications for every 25% overage that you have. So, if you initially paid for 1,000 responses and you now have 1,250 responses, you will get an email letting you know you are over your limit. For every 25% over, you will get a new email until the campaign time runs out, or you pay for the overage. Your contest will still be recording votes when you go over your response limit, however, you will not see them unless you go back to the Pay and Launch section and purchase the overage responses by selecting Purchase Responses to Offset Overage of X Responses - where X is the number of responses you are over. You should try go guess accurately how many responses you will get, as the overage price is slightly more than if you had purchased enough responses in the beginning. Once you pay for the overage, your Responses will show up in your Results. Billing . Billing The Billing section will contain all of the transactions you have had. They will be separated by Contest name and Questions. You can see each transaction you have had for each Question. The below summary shows that we paid for 1 Contest called Chicken Contest with 1 Question Which chicken do you like better?. We purchased it on 3/22/2023 with 3 answers and 15,000 responses (remember this was a big contest at a rodeo). Then, 2 days later we added an Answer (a new chicken) and paid for that. The same day, we added 1,500 more responses because they sold out the rodeo and we thought we could use the padding. Terminate Service . Terminate Service If you are finished using QR-Contest (we hope not), you may terminate your service in this section. There are 2 options: . Cancel Service - disable and archive data .

That will display a row of attributes you can change for the text. You may change the font color, bold, underline and italic. Photo . Click on the picture of the flowers and you may change the opacity of the image. The default is 100 - meaning completely opaque so nothing under the photo shows through. You can change the opacity so that the image background (see below) shows through or blends with the photo. The below sample shows the opacity at 50% on a white background, so it make the photo ‘lighter’. Background . Click on the empty space of the background and you may change the color. The default is white, so the color box above the preview is a little tricky to see. We’ve changed it to light yellow below: . Hot Tip . In the above image, you can see that the background of the QR code is white. We’ll change the background of the QR code to light blue with a 50% transparency (in the color picker). See below. The QR code background becomes light green because the light blue combined with the yellow of the overall Background will give you light green (blue + yellow = green). Make PNGs . When you are finished altering the properties, click Make PNGs to generate your PNG files. You will get a message saying “Generating document(s)…”, then a short animation with a message that says “Open your document(s) here:”. See below: . You have 3 options here: . | Clicking the far left icon will open the PNG files in a new tab in your browser and show you them in a list. This can be helpful if you want to individually print them or just access them without unzipping them. | Clicking the underlined text in the middle (a link to the .zip file) will download the resulting .zip file to your device. | Clicking the far right icon will copy the URL for the .zip file to your copy/paste buffer. | . If you get a message saying “No questions picked for this location” - you need to go back to the Questions and Answers section and make sure you have both at least one Question and at least one Answer per question. To show the Print/Download options again, close, then open the Print/Download accordion. PNG Zip Files . The .zip files generated when you create PNG images instead of PDF contains several files. | directory.json - this file is a directory listing of all questions and answers in the .zip file. The json file (a file for a programmer) contains information about each question and answer - including the file names corresponding to each Question and Answer. If you open it in a text editor, it is readable. Here is an example of the PNG files generated from our Chicken example: { \"location\": \"QR-vote location\", \"questions\": [ { \"id\": \"q_0\", \"question\": \"Which chicken do you like better?\", \"answers\": [ { \"id\": \"q_0_a_0\", \"text\": \"Lady Feathers\", \"image\": \"q_0_a_0.png\", \"size\": { \"width\": 1024, \"height\": 1024 } }, { \"id\": \"q_0_a_1\", \"text\": \"Yellow Fella\", \"image\": \"q_0_a_1.png\", \"size\": { \"width\": 1024, \"height\": 1024 } }, { \"id\": \"q_0_a_2\", \"text\": \"Joker\", \"image\": \"q_0_a_2.png\", \"size\": { \"width\": 1024, \"height\": 1024 } } ], \"image\": \"q_0.png\" } ] } . For QR-Contest, the “location” will always show up as “QR-vote location” (this has more meaning in QR-Answers). The Questions each have an index (the order they were entered in the Questions and Answers section). Each Answer also has an index. Both of these indeces start at 0 (sorry, a computer thing…). A Question is noted by the letter “q”; an Answers is noted by the letter “a”. Given the file names would be crazy long if we used the text of the question and answers, we thought it better to use numbers. So, if you want to find out what the 3rd answer in your first question looks like, you come up with it like this: Start with “q” (Question), then the index (0 since the first one starts at 0, not 1), add “a” for Answer, then the answer index, which for the 3rd one is 2; then put underscores (_) between each item. So, the file name of the first Question’s 3rd answer is: “q_0_a_2.png”. We also print out the Question text - the file name is constructed the same way: q_0.png is the first Question. The json file also has the size of each image. | . You can read up on json (why would you?), but a quick summary is this: each ‘object’ starts and ends with matched curly brackets { }; each array (list) starts and ends with square brackets [ ]. | Question files (see above), for example q_0.png | The Answer files for each question, for example q_0_a_0.png is the first answer to the first question | . Manual PNG . Manual PNG - Selecting this option will allow you to control every visual aspect of each of your questions and answers. See Auto PNG above to see how to change QR Code colors, Text attributes, Photo attributes, and the Background. You may change these for every Answer, or you can modify the 1st Answer to be the layout you would like to use for all of the Answers and choose Apply current layout to all. In addition, if you are on an Answer past the first one, you can use the Match Previous button to match the layout of the Answer you are on to the previous Answer. The Manual PNG layout also allows you to modify the Photo to be Contain or Cover. See the section Question Page Appearance for a description. Click on the Photo and above the Opacity setting will be a checkbox. The default setting is the aspect correct the image and size the containing box around it so that if you resize the box, the image will aspect fill the box. However, if you uncheck the box, you will have two choices. The left is Cover and the right is Contain. You may play with these to see what they do. In addition to colors, fonts, etc. you may also manually locate any of the object in the preview area. Select an object (text, QR code, photo) and you will see gripper handles on the 4 corners of the object (the image above has them around the QR code). You may change the size of the object by dragging the gripper handles, or you may click and drag the middle of the object to relocate it. The stacking order of the objects is: QR Code on top, then the Text answer (if any), then the Photo (if any), then the background. Changing the size of the Text box will increase or decrease the font size to fit your Answer into the box. You may traverse through the Question(s) and Answers using the left and right arrows. When you are done laying out the PNG files, you should press Make PNGs. The PNG files will be generated see here. If you do not traverse through all the questions or answers, the ones you have not visited will use the auto-layout algorithm. ",

To add a new Question, you click on the plus sign Add Question. An empty text box will appear where you enter the Question. You may add multiple Questions per contest prior to paying for and launching your contest. See the NOTE below. First Contest . If this is your first Contest, you will see the plus sign Add Question item. Click it to add your first question. If you return to this screen and the plus sign Add Question does not appear, it is because you have already purchased this Contest and Question. If this is the case, a small help icon will appear to the right of the paid for question reminding you that you cannot add or change this quesiton. You may not add new Questions to an already launched contest. However, it is possible to add new Answers to an already paid for Question. Click the question and you will see the paid for answers with a lock next to them, but the plus sign Add Answer will be available. You may add the new Answers and then go to the Pay and Launch accordion to pay for them. To add a new Question, create a new contest and add the question there. Previous Contest Exists - Copy . If you created a previous contest, when you first go to a new contest, you will see the below interface - which allows you to do two things: 1) Copy Questions and Answers from a prior Contest; 2) Paste Questions and Answers from a spreadsheet that has a specific format. Copy Question(s) from other Contest . If you have prior Contests, and you are creating a brand new Contest, the first (and only first) time you go to add Questions to your new Contest, you will see a drop down with a list of your prior Contests. You may copy those Questions (and Answers if you choose the Inlude Answers checkbox) into this Contest by selecting the Contest and choosing Copy. You will see the Questions copied over to this Contest as new Questions. Paste Questions and Answers from Excel . Sometimes, it is easier to enter your Questions and Answers into a spreadsheet (maybe you already have some there) and then copying those and pasting them into the app. You have to set up your spreadsheet exactly like the exmaple above. The format is a Question in column A on a single line and the Answers in column B on subsequent lines. You can copy/paste multiple questions by repeating the above pattern. Select the 2 columns from Excel and choose copy (CTRL+C or CMD+C), then go back to the app page and press the Paste button (not CTRL+V or CMD+V). That will paste your Questions and Answers into the app. Questions . When you click the plus sign Add Question, a text box should appear for you to start typing into. If it does not, you may also edit the Question text by pressing the Edit icon to the left of the text. You will get the Edit Question form shown below. Alternatively, long pressing the empty text area will also edit inline without the form. If you do not want to edit anything, you may press the back chevron in the upper left. You may delete this question by presing the Delete button. If you make any changes, be sure to press the Update button. You may add Tags that may be used in any Contest. You add a tag by typing the tag value, in the case below, ‘chicken’ was typed. That will add the tag to your global tags. If you have other tags, they will auto-complete as you start to type them. So, if you add ‘chicken’ here and later in an Answer you type ‘ch’ - it should auto-complete to ‘chicken’. The tags are to assist you in organizing your information. They will show up in the user interface on a later update to the application. Answers . To add answers, you need to click on the Question (you’ll see a up/down chevron on the right of the question). When you click the plus sign Add Answer, a text box should appear for you to start typing into (just like Questions). Below you’ll see we added 3 Answers. Any time you have text in a list, you may long-press on it to edit the text inline. This saves you steps from pressing the pencil and editing the text in a form. Reorder Answers . The up/down arrows icon on the left of each Answer allows you to reorder the Answers. Long press on the up/down arrows and then drag the Answer to the position you would like. The Answers will show up in your PDF or PNG files in the order you have them here. Edit Answer . You may edit the Answer details by pressing the pencil icon to the left of the text. You will get the Edit Answer form shown below. Answers may be either Text, Photo or both. The default type is a Text answer. You would enter the Answer in the Text Answer box. If you would like to add a Photo to your Answer, check the Photo checkbox and then choose either Enter URL, Upload or Take Photo. After completing your choice, the image will show up in the Image Preview area. You may rotate your image by using the left and right rotate icons. After you press the Update button, you will not be able to rotate the image, you will have to re-enter it to rotate it. You may add Tags that may be used in any Contest. You add a tag by typing the tag value. That will add the tag to your global tags. If you have other tags, they will auto-complete as you start to type them. The Description area is for your own use. Optional Answer Link . Optional Answer Link This option is very powerful. You specify a link that will either show up on the Results page (after the user scans a QR code answer), or will automatically redirect the user to the Link. Link - Selecting this option will show a Link on the Results page. The Text of the link (the highlighted text the user may click on) can be entered in the Link Text box. For example, if you would like to collect some demographic information, or have someone sign up for your newsletter after then scan the Answer, put “SignUp for Newsletter” as the Link Text and enter the URL for your SignUp form in the Link URL. Below we show a sample where a voter scanned the QR code for the Model S and the Link Text was “Model S” and the Link URL was https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/tesla-model-s.pdf . Results after scanning . Automatic Redirect - instead of showing the Results page, the user will be automatically redirected to the Link URL. The Link Text is not used. So, when the voter selects the QR code answer, the vote will be recorded and they will be redirected to the URL you put in the Link URL. Clicking on the underlined Model S will take the voter to the Model S PDF file. This can be used in many ways; for example, let’s say you wanted to distribute some documents. Perhaps your “Question” would be: Download a spec sheet for? Then the answers would say “Model S”, “Model X”, “Model Y”. Then, for each answer, you would select Automatic Redirect and have the Link URL go to https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/tesla-model-s.pdf for the Model S, etc. PDF . Results after scanning .
