    "content": "This section allows you to choose many different options for your contest - from frequency of voting to how to display the output PDF or PNG files. We’ll look at each section by section. Be sure to press the Update button at the bottom to save your changes. General Options . Limit Responses (per user) - This determines how many times a voter (someone who scans the QR code) can vote. The default is Once. This will allow a person to have just one vote that counts. They can change votes by scanning another one, but that will cancel their first vote. You may also choose: . Hourly - can vote one time per hour . Daily - can vote one time per day . Once - (default) can vote one time only . No Limit - can vote as many times as they want . How do you limit votes? - When a voter scans the QR code, the app will drop a cookie in the voter’s browser. The voter has to have cookies enabled, or they may not vote. The cookie does not identify the voter, it just records the fact that they voted. Question Page Header (2 lines maximum) - This text will appear at the top of the generated PDF file. It will not show on a PNG image if you choose that output option later. The text should help the voter understand what they are supposed to do. The default of Use your phone’s camera to vote. Scan, Click, Done. is an example. You may put anything you like there - but it has a maximum of 2 lines. Question Page Appearance . 1. QR Code - You may choose the outer Code Style (circle, square), internal Code Shape and foreground and background colors of the QR code that is generated for your answers. The default internal Code Shape is a square, but there are many options. Press the left and right arrow buttons to choose your code. You should be sure to try your choice out at the size you print so you can verify the code will scan. You can choose the colors of the QR code by clicking on the foreground (left box) and background (right box) color boxes. Logo - Optionally, you may add a logo that gets printed on the lower left of the generated PDF - it will not show up if you choose PNG output. You may Upload an image from your device, or you can Take Photo if your device supports it. Make sure if you alter any values in this section, you need to scroll down and press the Update button. 2. Default QR Layout for Text Answers - Currently, there is no choice here. If your answers are text-only (vs photo or photo + text), then they will print with the QR code above the text of the answer. 3. Default QR Layout for Photo Answers - The images show the layout of the QR code (shown in color) vs. the image (shown in grey). For example, the first one shows the QR code in the upper left (default) and the image behind and to the right of it. You may choose the position of the QR code by selecting one of the 6 choices. The below image shows how this is printed when you have image answers with answer text in an Auto PDF. 4. Fit and Opacity for Photo Answers - You may choose how photos are scaled into the viewable area by selecting Cover or Contain. Cover means that the photo will comletely fill the static rectangle area of the destination (like the image above). Contain will scale the photo proportionately keeping its aspect ratio into the destination rectangle - so that you see the whole photo (below). 2., 3. and 4. above are only used when using the Auto PNG output format. Opacity can be controlled by moving the slider left or right. By default, the photo will completely overwrite whatever is under it. For example, on PNG files, it is possible to make the background of the screen a color (say blue) and then change the opacity of the photo so that the background ‘bleeds through’ the photo. You can play with this to see the effects it has in the varying output formats. QR Scan Response Chart Style . Select chart style - After the user scans an answer, they are redirected to a page that will show them a “Thank You” page, horizontal bar chart, vertical bar chart, pie chart, or a gradient chart. The “Thank You” page will not display any results. Both of the other chart types will display the results of prior votes and the current user’s vote. You may pick which type of page is displayed here (pie or gradient). Also, you may skip the results page by specifying a Link Url and Automatic Redirect under the Optional Answer Link when you edit each Answer under the Edit Answer screen. ",

Rsponse Quota - Receive information about depleting Response quota by subsrbing to this mailing list. The default is ‘on’. You will get notifications for every 25% overage that you have. So, if you initially paid for 1,000 responses and you now have 1,250 responses, you will get an email letting you know you are over your limit. For every 25% over, you will get a new email until the campaign time runs out, or you pay for the overage. Your contest will still be recording votes when you go over your response limit, however, you will not see them unless you go back to the Pay and Launch section and purchase the overage responses by selecting Purchase Responses to Offset Overage of X Responses - where X is the number of responses you are over. You should try go guess accurately how many responses you will get, as the overage price is slightly more than if you had purchased enough responses in the beginning. Once you pay for the overage, your Responses will show up in your Results. Subscription ending - Notify Me of approaching Quota end via Email. When you purchase a Contest, there is a pre-defined timeframe associated with the Contest. You may receive a notification when there is 1 week or 1 day left in your Contest. You may increase the time of your contest by going to the Pay and Launch section of the Contest Detail page.

Billing The Billing section will contain all of the transactions you have had. They will be separated by Contest name and Questions. You can see each transaction you have had for each Question. The below summary shows that we paid for 1 Contest called Chicken Contest with 1 Question Which chicken do you like better?. We purchased it on 3/22/2023 with 3 answers and 15,000 responses (remember this was a big contest at a rodeo). Then, 2 days later we added an Answer (a new chicken) and paid for that. The same day, we added 1,500 more responses because they sold out the rodeo and we thought we could use the padding. Dashboard Key . Dashboard Key The Dashboard Key section will show your personal Dashboard API Key. This key is used as a part of the URL for your contest results dashboards. If you change the API Key, the URLs you generated before will no longer be valid. So, you should only change (called Roll API Key) the API Key when you want to disable all prior URLs. After you ‘roll’ the API Key, you may go to each contest’s Dashboard section and generate a new URL to be shared. Terminate Service . Terminate Service If you are finished using QR-Contest (we hope not), you may terminate your service in this section. There are 2 options: . Cancel Service - disable and archive data . This option will mark all of your data as archived in our backend and remove your user account. You may contact us at a later date to re-enable your account and data. We will only hold onto your archived data for no more than 60 days. After that, the data will be removed and we will be unable to restore it.

The purchase history and options to purchase other items will show up there. Here is an example of a single Question being purchased that has 3 answers. All 3 answers have been paid for. Purchasing Additional Answers . If you had a late flower entry like the example above, you might see (3 answers, 2 purchased) and the dropdown would recommend you paying for the 3rd answer, otherwise it would not be counted in the voting. See below: . Keep in mind you can always disable an Answer by going back to the Questions and Answers page, clicking on the locked icon (after you purchased) and choose to disable it. This might be useful if someone brought some chilli that made everyone sick and you didn’t want anyone else to vote for it. ",

    "content": "This section allows you to choose whether to output to an Auto generated PDF(s) for your Question(s) and Answers or to output PNG files (individual images per file) or to Avery© labels, or to manually layout a PDF, SVG, or STL (3d Printable) . You are allowed to print your contest so that you may test the voting. Until you launch your contest by paying for it, the results will only show the last vote scanned. So, if you have a question with 3 answers and you print a PDF out, you can test your campaign by scanning them one at a time and seeing the results. Each time you scan (no matter who scans), the prior result will be removed. You can think of this as a ‘draft’ mode where you are just testing your contest, but not really aggregating results. After testing and your’re ready to launch/publish your contest, go to Pay and Launch . Auto PDF . Auto PDF - this will output one PDF per Question. The Answers will be arranged automatically on the page. You should not put more than 6 answers on a Question if you want them to layout correctly on a single PDF. You may choose Lanscape (the default) or Portrait orientation for the PDF. The other settings are explained in the Configure Options section above. Setting them here will override the Configure Options values. If you have Adobe Acrobat or the new free Microsoft Edge PDF Editor, you may edit the generated PDF and place things wherever you like. Just be sure to not modify the QR codes in the document. Also, when you print the PDF make sure you check the Actual Size radio button on your print dialog. The PDFs are generated with precise measurements and should not be scaled. PNG . PNG - Selecting this option will allow you to control every visual aspect of each of your questions and answers and output them to multiple PNG files. Each Question will be in a separate PNG and each answer will be in their own PNG file. The software will also generate a ‘directory’ so that you know which Questions and Answers go together. The program will automatically layout each answer to make them look nicely when output. However, you may adjust any aspect of each PNG by following the below procedures. You may change each property for every Answer, or you can modify the 1st Answer to be the layout you would like to use for all of the Answers and choose Apply current layout to all… - you will then be prompted to select whethe ry ou want to apply the layout to All Questions (this Location), All Answers (this Question) or Cancel. All Questions (this Location) - for QR-Contest, there is only 1 Location per Question. However, your contest may have multiple Questions. Pressing this button will apply the current layout choices to all Questions and their Answers. All Answers (this Question) - Pressing this button will apply the current layout choices to all Answers for this Question. If you have multiple Questions, pressing this will not affect the other Questions. Use the arrow buttons at the top to change Questions and Answers. In addition, if you are on an Answer past the first one, you can use the Match Previous button to match the layout of the Answer you are on to the previous Answer. In addition to colors, fonts, etc. you may also manually locate any of the object in the preview area. Select an object (text, QR code, photo) and you will see gripper handles on the 4 corners of the object (the image above has them around the QR code). You may change the size of the object by dragging the gripper handles, or you may click and drag the middle of the object to relocate it. The stacking order of the objects is: QR Code on top, then the Text answer (if any), then the Photo (if any), then the background. Changing the size of the Text box will increase or decrease the font size to fit your Answer into the box if the auto-scale text icon is chosen (the default). You may traverse through the Question(s) and Answers using the left and right arrows. When you are done laying out the PNG files, you should press Make PNGs. The PNG files will be generated see here. If you do not traverse through all the questions or answers, the ones you have not visited will use the auto-layout algorithm. You may choose the resulting size of the PNG files by changing the Size (width x height). Or, you may choose a pre-defined size (like for your Canon Ivy Printer, so you can print stickers!). We update this list often. If you are looking to output Avery® labels, you should use the Avery® radio button on the Print/Download section. You may also change the QR Code colors, Text style and photo transparency (if you have photo answers). Click on an object in the preview to set the properties. For example, the QR code is selected by default when you first get to this screen. You can change the foreground and background colors of the QR code as well as the shape of the little internal ‘rectangles’. QR Code . To change the colors, click on the left color box for foreground or the right color box for background. Then, select a color from the color picker. You’ll see the preview update with your changes. To make the color picker go away, click outside of it. To change the shape of the internal ‘rectangles’, use the left and right arrow buttons. You can choose circle, triangle, hexagon, star, etc. Text . Click on the Text Here (whatever your text answer is) at the top of the preview. That will display a row of attributes you can change for the text. You may change the font color, bold, underline and italic. If the auto-scale text icon is chosen, the text will scale to fit/fill the text box area. If you select the radio button to manually enter the font size and justification, then the auto-scale will be disabled. You may enter decimal numbers for the font, but be careful, as we have not put any limits on the size at this point. If you type 300, you’re going to get a big chunk of text that will overflow the box. If your answer does not have text, it will not appear in the layout. Photo . Click on the picture of your answer (if you have a photo) and you may change the opacity of the image. The default is 100 - meaning completely opaque so nothing under the photo shows through. You can change the opacity so that the image background (see below) shows through or blends with the photo. The below sample shows the opacity at 50% on a white background, so it make the photo ‘lighter’. If your answer does not have a photo, it will not appear in the layout. The PNG layout also allows you to modify the Photo to be Contain or Cover. See the section Question Page Appearance for a description. Click on the Photo and above the Opacity setting will be a checkbox. The default setting for PNG is to use Cover (the far left radio button) - which means the image will fill the layout box. If you choose the right radio button, the image will be set to be ‘Contained’ in the result rectangle. You may play with these to see what they do. If you choose the check box on the far right, that means to scale the photo to be the same aspect ratio as the source and to restrict its sizing to match that aspect ratio. Unchecking the box will revert to Cover and Contain mode. Background . Click on the empty space of the background and you may change the color. The default is white, so the color box above the preview is a little tricky to see. We’ve changed it to light yellow below: . Hot Tip . In the above image, you can see that the background of the QR code is white. We’ll change the background of the QR code to light blue with a 50% transparency (in the color picker). See below. The QR code background becomes light green because the light blue combined with the yellow of the overall Background will give you light green (blue + yellow = green). Make PNGs . When you are finished altering the properties, click Make PNGs to generate your PNG files. You will get a message saying “Generating document(s)…”, then a short animation with a message that says “Open your document(s) here:”. See below: . You have 2 options here: . | Clicking the underlined text in the middle (a link to the .zip file) will download the resulting .zip file to your device. | Clicking the far right icon will copy the URL for the .zip file to your copy/paste buffer. | . If you get a message saying “No questions picked for this location” - you need to go back to the Questions and Answers section and make sure you have both at least one Question and at least one Answer per question. To show the Print/Download options again, close, then open the Print/Download accordion. PNG Zip Files . The .zip files generated when you create PNG images instead of PDF contains several files. | directory.json - this file is a directory listing of all questions and answers in the .zip file. The json file (a file for a programmer) contains information about each question and answer - including the file names corresponding to each Question and Answer. If you open it in a text editor, it is readable. Here is an example of the PNG files generated from our Chicken example: { \"location\": \"QR-vote location\", \"questions\": [ { \"id\": \"q_0\", \"question\": \"Which chicken do you like better?\", \"answers\": [ { \"id\": \"q_0_a_0\", \"text\": \"Lady Feathers\", \"image\": \"q_0_a_0.png\", \"size\": { \"width\": 1024, \"height\": 1024 } }, { \"id\": \"q_0_a_1\", \"text\": \"Yellow Fella\", \"image\": \"q_0_a_1.png\", \"size\": { \"width\": 1024, \"height\": 1024 } }, { \"id\": \"q_0_a_2\", \"text\": \"Joker\", \"image\": \"q_0_a_2.png\", \"size\": { \"width\": 1024, \"height\": 1024 } } ], \"image\": \"q_0.png\" } ] } . For QR-Contest, the “location” will always show up as “QR-vote location” (this has more meaning in QR-Answers). The Questions each have an index (the order they were entered in the Questions and Answers section). Each Answer also has an index. Both of these indeces start at 0 (sorry, a computer thing…). A Question is noted by the letter “q”; an Answers is noted by the letter “a”. Given the file names would be crazy long if we used the text of the question and answers, we thought it better to use numbers. So, if you want to find out what the 3rd answer in your first question looks like, you come up with it like this: Start with “q” (Question), then the index (0 since the first one starts at 0, not 1), add “a” for Answer, then the answer index, which for the 3rd one is 2; then put underscores (_) between each item. So, the file name of the first Question’s 3rd answer is: “q_0_a_2.png”. We also print out the Question text - the file name is constructed the same way: q_0.png is the first Question. The json file also has the size of each image. | . You can read up on json (why would you?), but a quick summary is this: each ‘object’ starts and ends with matched curly brackets { }; each array (list) starts and ends with square brackets [ ]. We also output a tsv (tab separated value) file with the directory if that is easier for you to use in Excel or another spreadsheet. | Question files (see above), for example q_0.png | The Answer files for each question, for example q_0_a_0.png is the first answer to the first question | . Avery ® . Avery® - Selecting this option will allow you to output your Answers to Avery® labels/documents. It works just like PNG above, but you are able to choose a different Avery label Template for each Question’s Answers. You may see more Avery Templates by going to Avery® Templates. For example, if you want to print your first Question’s Answers on Avery® Label 94100 - they will be 4” by 4” square labels. If you choose, Avery® 5160, you will get a 2.63” by 1” label for each Answer. We currently support US sizes (Letter), but will be adding A4 sizes shortly. The visual representation on the screen will match the aspect ratio of the chosen label. If you change the Template choice, you will be asked which Questions or Answers you would like to apply the change to. You may change for all Questions’ Answers in this Contest, or just this Question’s Answers. Typically, you probably will only have one Question in a Contest, but it is possible to have more than one, so modifying the Template will affect only the choice from the popup. If you choose Avery as the output type, the Questions themselves will not be printed - for example “Which photo do you like more?” from below. You can print a PDF with the actual Question text, or just print it using Word or some other Text editor. We thought it would look funny to print the Question on a label, but if you think not, let us know… Also, like PDFs, make sure you choose Actual Size in your printer dialog so that the labels print precisely where they are supposed to. You may control every visual aspect of each of your Answers by using the same process as described above in the PNG section. The only other option not in the PNG layout described above is the Safe checkbox. If you select the checkbox, there will be a 1/8” dotted nmargin put around the actual label size so that you don’t overrun your label dimensions if the paper isn’t placed precisely in the printer. If you uncheck the Safe checkbox, you may move any text, photo or QR code to the absolute edge of the label. Avery and all Avery brands, product names and codes are trademarks of Avery Products Corporation. PDF . PDF - Selecting this option will allow you to output your Answers to a PDF, but you may manually layout each area of the PDF vs. the “Auto PDF” choice. | Select the size dropdown and choose whether you want Landscape or Portrait (US Letter) orientation and how many Answers per page you would like to have. The Questions and Question Page Header are printed on each page if there are more answers than fit on a single page. | . In Lanscape orientation, 1 per page will fill the entire page (except where the Question, Header and bottom logos print). The 2 per page will place them side by side; 3 per page will put them side by side in a single row; 4 per page will divide the page into 2 rows of 2; 5 per page will put 3 in the top row and 2 in the bottom (centered); 6 per page will make 2 rows of 3 across. In Portrait orientation, 1 per page will fill the page; 2 per page will put them in a column; 3 per page will be 1 column; 4 per page will split into 2 rows and columns; 5 per page will make 3 rows - 2 in the 1st 2 rows and 1 in the bottom row; 6 per page will have 3 rows of 2. Play with it, you’ll figure it out. The area you are designing is one of the cells - all cells are the same size depending on what orientation and ‘per page’ you choose, the aspect ratio of the design surface will change and match the output aspect ratio. Keep in mind that for this style of layout, there are no margins between the cells - so you should leave some white space around the edges of the design surface or add a colored background. You are able to layout each and every cell if you like, or layout the first one and choose Apply current layout to all…. However, if you are doing a ‘serious’ research project, you may want to make sure all choices look the same so that the layout doesn’t dissuade or draw someone’s attention to something other than the Answer… . The customizations work like the PNG and Avery® label layouts described in detail above. HTML . HTML - Selecting this option will allow you to output your Answers to HTML page(s), but you may manually layout each area of the HTML. | Select the Answers per page dropdown and choose whether you want Landscape or Portrait (US Letter) orientation and how many Answers per page you would like to have. The Questions and Question Page Header are printed on each page if there are more answers than fit on a single page. | . In Lanscape orientation, 1 per page will fill the entire page (except where the Question, Header and bottom logos print). The 2 per page will place them side by side; 3 per page will put them side by side in a single row; 4 per page will divide the page into 2 rows of 2; 5 per page will put 3 in the top row and 2 in the bottom (centered); 6 per page will make 2 rows of 3 across. In Portrait orientation, 1 per page will fill the page; 2 per page will put them in a column; 3 per page will be 1 column; 4 per page will split into 2 rows and columns; 5 per page will make 3 rows - 2 in the 1st 2 rows and 1 in the bottom row; 6 per page will have 3 rows of 2.

The customizations work like the PNG and Avery® label layouts described in detail above. SVG . SVG - Selecting this option will allow you to output your Answers to SVG (scalable vector graphics) files, but you may manually layout each area of the SVG. | Choose the width and height of the SVG. | . The area you are designing is one of the cells. Each SVG is whatever size you choose for each one. By default, it will output to all the same size, unless you change the size on an individual answer. You are able to layout each and every cell if you like, or layout the first one and choose Apply current layout to all…. However, if you are doing a ‘serious’ research project, you may want to make sure all choices look the same so that the layout doesn’t draw someone’s attention to something other than the Answer… . The customizations work like the PNG and Avery® label layouts described in detail above. STL (Experimental) . STL - Selecting this option will allow you to output your Answers to STL (Stereolithography) files, but you may manually layout each area of the STL like above. STL is a 3D printing format supported by most Slicers for 3D printers. We use a Creality Combo Color in the office as our QR printer. | Choose the width and height of the STL in millimeters (mm). You may control the base thickness by setting the base height in mm. You may also control the height of the printed QR code, text and image (if any) with the top value in mm. You should try to choose an output size large enough that the QR code details print reasonably well so they can be scanned. | . What we do is use the slicer and put a PAUSE at the layer where the ‘top’ starts. That way we can print a ‘white’ bottom, then switch the fillament to black or another color so that the QR code and image print in black. See this photo; the bottom is white, the top is black (corresponding to the dimensions chosen above). The photo doesn’t do the 3D print justice, but you get the idea. The images are handled with a dithering algorithm to convert the greyscale of the image to black and white dots (or a lithophane). If you click on the image, you will see some settings for how the image scales, centers, etc. There is also a dropdown to determine what dithering algorithm you would like to use. The default is Min Error, which does a descent job. If you are printing to a lithophane (kind of a 3d relief), choose Lithophane. We default the lithophane size to 108 x 144 mm, 1.2mm base and .8mm top. Then we print it all in white (or a light color). You can get a ‘light box’ from Bambu Labs that will hold this and backlight it for you - which looks and work great. The Lithophane Frame is licensed under Creative Commons (4.0 International License). See below photo. You’ll need to experiment with your slicer settings to make sure the QR code is readable. If you print something too small, a phone will not be able to scan the QR code. So, be sure to test it after you print it, if it does not work, increase the size. Below is a photo of the side view of a 3D print. The bottom . The area you are designing is one of the cells. Each STL is whatever size you choose for each one. By default, it will output to all the same size, unless you change the size on an individual answer.

To add a new Question, you click on the plus sign Add Question. An empty text box will appear where you enter the Question. You may add multiple Questions per contest prior to paying for and launching your contest. See the NOTE below. First Contest . If this is your first Contest, you will see the plus sign Add Question item. Click it to add your first question. If you return to this screen and the plus sign Add Question does not appear, it is because you have already purchased this Contest and Question. If this is the case, a small help icon will appear to the right of the paid for question reminding you that you cannot add or change this quesiton. You may not add new Questions to an already launched contest. However, it is possible to add new Answers to an already paid for Question. After purchase, you may disable an Answer by clicking on the lock icon and choosing Yes to disable it. You may re-enable it by clicking on the subsequent cirlce with the line through it. To add an Answer, click the question and you will see the paid for answers with a lock next to them, but the plus sign Add Answer will be available. You may add the new Answers and then go to the Pay and Launch accordion to pay for them. To add a new Question, create a new contest and add the question there. Previous Contest Exists - Copy . If you created a previous contest, when you first go to a new contest, you will see the below interface - which allows you to do three things: 1) Add a new Question; 2) Copy Questions and Answers from a prior Contest; 3) Paste Questions and Answers from a spreadsheet that has a specific format. Copy Question(s) from other Contest . If you have prior Contests, and you are creating a brand new Contest, the first (and only first) time you go to add Questions to your new Contest, you will see a drop down with a list of your prior Contests. You may copy those Questions (and Answers if you choose the Inlude Answers checkbox) into this Contest by selecting the Contest and choosing Copy. You will see the Questions copied over to this Contest as new Questions. ‘Smart Paste’ Questions and Answers from Excel . Sometimes, it is easier to enter your Questions and Answers into a spreadsheet (maybe you already have some there) and then copying those and pasting them into the app. If you don’t use column headers, you need to set up your spreadsheet exactly like the example below. Here is a template you may use to put the information into the correct columns with headers. sample_upload.xlsx . The format is a Question in column A on a single line and the Answers in column B on subsequent lines. You can copy/paste multiple questions by repeating the above pattern. Select the 2 columns from Excel and choose copy (CTRL+C or CMD+C). You may paste these into the app in 2 different ways. Press the Paste button and it will extract the data from the clipboard. Or, you can choose Add Question and when the text entry box is flashing like below, press the keyboard combination of (CTRL+V or CMD+V). That will paste your Questions and Answers into the app. If you use column headers, you can copy/paste more information in varying formats. Questions have 3 fields: text, tags and description. Answers have 7 fields: text, tags, description, imageUrl, linkAction, linkDescription. The explanation of these fields is below. You don’t have to use all of the fields, but be sure to have a field named “text”. If you are only going to paste Questions with no Answers, you can use a spreadsheet with column headers of “text”, “tags”, “description” - like the below. Copy the information from the spreadsheet, including the headers, then open a Question text edit box and paste the information. The app will figure out where to put everything for you. The below will create 2 questions. Here is a sample spreadsheet: . Note that tags are pipe | delimited (the vertical bar). If you would like to just paste Answers, you may use any of the fields above (be sure to include a column named “text”). Copy the area of the spreadsheet and open a text edit area for a new Answer; then paste the values. The below will create 5 answers. Here is a sample spreadsheet: . Perhaps the easiest way to paste both Questions and Answers is to use a more clearly formatted header row. Just put ‘question.’ in front of the Question fields or ‘answer.’ in front of the Answer fields. For example, you could have ‘question.text’, ‘answers.text’ as the 2 columns, when you paste them, you will get Questions with the associated Answers when you paste the values into a question edit text box. Leave blank values in the ‘question.text’ column where you have ‘answers.text’ values. The below will create 2 questions. The first question - “How are you today?” - will have 2 answers (“Fine” and “SoSo”); the second question - “What size?” - will have 3 answers (“Small”, “Medium”, “Large”). Here is a sample spreadsheet (right click it an open it in a new tab to be able to read it better): . The header fields listed above are: “question.text”, “question.tags”, “question.description”, “answer.text”, “answer.tags”, “answer.description”, “answer.linkaction”, “answer.link”, “answer.linkdescription”, “answer.imageurl”. Question Fields . text - This is the text that will display as the question. Be sure to include the question mark if it is a question. For example: “How was your service today?” . tags - These are used to help organize things. To apply multiple tags, separate them with a vertical bar | character. description - This can be used for you to keep any notes . Answer Fields . text - The text to display for the Answers. If you leave this blank, then you must supply an imageUrl field. Note that you can have text or imageUrl or both for your answer. If you only supply an imageUrl then your answer will be displayed as the image. If you supply only a text value, then your answer will only dispay the text. If you supply both, your answer will display both the text and imageUrl . tags - These are used to help organize things. To apply multiple tags, separate them with a vertical bar | character. description - To keep any notes . linkaction - This has to be either ‘embed’ or ‘redirect’. Any other value will be ignored and dropped. embed means to embed a hyperlink into the Answer results page. So, after the user scans a QR code, they are presented a results page and on that page the embedded link will show up with the text of the link showing the linkDesription field below. The hyperlink itself will be the link field as described below. If you select redirect, then the linkDescription field is ignored and the user will not be taken to a results page, but will be automatically redirected to the link hyperlink. The answer will be recorded, but the user will not see the aggregated results. link - See linkaction above. This is either the hyperlink embedded on the results page or the link that the user us automatically redirected to if linkaction is redirect. For example, you could put a link on the results page that goes to your website, or you can use redirect to automatically redirect the user to a survey or other location. linkdescription - This is the text of the hyperlinnk if linkaction is set to embed. It is isgnored when redirect is chosen for linkaction. imageurl - This is a URL of an image that can be displayed as or along with your answer’s text field. See text above. Questions . When you click the plus sign Add Question, a text box should appear for you to start typing into. If it does not, you may also edit the Question text by pressing the Edit icon to the left of the text. You will get the Edit Question form shown below. Alternatively, long pressing the empty text area will also edit inline without the form. If you do not want to edit anything, you may press the back chevron in the upper left. You may delete this question by presing the Delete button. If you make any changes, be sure to press the Update button. You may add Tags that may be used in any Contest. You add a tag by typing the tag value, in the case below, ‘chicken’ was typed. That will add the tag to your global tags. If you have other tags, they will auto-complete as you start to type them. So, if you add ‘chicken’ here and later in an Answer you type ‘ch’ - it should auto-complete to ‘chicken’. The tags are to assist you in organizing your information. They will show up in the user interface on a later update to the application. Answers . To add answers, you need to click on the Question (you’ll see a up/down chevron on the right of the question). When you click the plus sign Add Answer, a text box should appear for you to start typing into (just like Questions). Below you’ll see we added 3 Answers. Any time you have text in a list, you may long-press on it to edit the text inline. This saves you steps from pressing the pencil and editing the text in a form. Reorder Answers . The up/down arrows icon on the left of each Answer allows you to reorder the Answers. Long press on the up/down arrows and then drag the Answer to the position you would like. The Answers will show up in your PDF or PNG files in the order you have them here. Edit Answer . You may edit the Answer details by pressing the pencil icon to the left of the text. You will get the Edit Answer form shown below. Answers may be either Text, Photo or both. The default type is a Text answer. You would enter the Answer in the Text Answer box. If you would like to add a Photo to your Answer, you may choose a free suggestion image by checking the Show free use Images checkbox. When you type Text and tab out of the Text box, the suggestion images will appear. You may click on one to choose it. A nice trick for having only an image as an answer is to type into the Text box to find the image, click on it, then uncheck the Text box.

You specify a link that will either show up on the Results page (after the user scans a QR code answer), or will automatically redirect the user to the Link. Link - Selecting this option will show a Link on the Results page. The Text of the link (the highlighted text the user may click on) can be entered in the Link Text box. For example, if you would like to collect some demographic information, or have someone sign up for your newsletter after then scan the Answer, put “SignUp for Newsletter” as the Link Text and enter the URL for your SignUp form in the Link URL. Below we show a sample where a voter scanned the QR code for the Model S and the Link Text was “Model S” and the Link URL was https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/tesla-model-s.pdf . Results after scanning . You may change the displayed graphic by changing it under Configure Options . Automatic Redirect - instead of showing the Results page, the user will be automatically redirected to the Link URL. The Link Text is not used. So, when the voter selects the QR code answer, the vote will be recorded and they will be redirected to the URL you put in the Link URL. Clicking on the underlined Model S will take the voter to the Model S PDF file. This can be used in many ways; for example, let’s say you wanted to distribute some documents. Perhaps your “Question” would be: Download a spec sheet for? Then the answers would say “Model S”, “Model X”, “Model Y”. Then, for each answer, you would select Automatic Redirect and have the Link URL go to https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/tesla-model-s.pdf for the Model S, etc. PDF . Results after scanning .
