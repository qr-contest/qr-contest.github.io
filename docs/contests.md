You may add Questions and Answers, then optionally Configure your Contest presentation, print sample output and ultimately
pay for your Contest to go live.  See more [here](contests/contest_overview).

All of your Contests will be listed here.  You may also use the magnifying glass in the upper right corner to search for a specific Contest.
There is also a filter icon to allow you to choose between viewing Active and Archived Contest.  You may Archive a Contest by clicking on the 
Contest name, then choosing the Edit icon in the upper right.  Archive will be a choice on that edit screen
