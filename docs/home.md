## Recent Results
<div class="accordion-bar">Recent Results</div>
  Selecting this section will allow you to see the latest results from your contest(s).  If nothing is shown, then there are no recent
  results to display.  Results are shown in graphical format (pie chart, bar chart, etc.).  

  <p align="center" class="screen-shot">

## Viewing Mode
<div class="accordion-bar">Viewing Mode</div>
Viewing Mode is used from a mobile device to allow you to test your contest without registering any votes.  
The default is for your device to record votes after you scan a QR code.  To test your QR codes, you may select
VIEW RESULTS to see how many votes have been cast, but your scan will not register as a vote.

  <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle"></i></span>Set QR Scan Mode to RECORD votes from this device.<br/>
  <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i></span>Set QR Scan Mode to VIEW RESULTS from this device - responses will not be recorded.

## Billing Transaction
<div class="accordion-bar">Billing Transaction</div>
This section will only show up immediately after you have purchased something. See [Purchase Confirmation](./contests/pay_launch#purchase-confirmation) for details.  It will show a summary of the purchase here - but only directly after the purchase.  If you want to see a list of all purchases, click the menu icon <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-bars"></i></span> in the upper right and choose Edit Profile, then Billing.  All transactions will show up there.  If you want to see the billing items for a particular Contest, go to the Contest Detail page and scroll down to the [Pay and Launch](./contests/pay_launch#contest-purchase-history) section.

## Menu <span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-bars"></i></span>
In the upper right corner of the Home tab is the 3 bar menu.  This menu allows you to edit your profile (Change Password, Notifications, Billing, Terminate Service) or Log Out.

  <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
  <img class="image-border" alt="home tab menu" src="../../assets/images/home_menu.png">
  </p>

Below are the sections after choosing **Edit Profile**.

### Change Password
<div class="accordion-bar">Change Password</div>
Your username will show at the top of the section, followed by a place to enter your old password and to enter your new password and confirm it.  Once you hit the <span class="inline-button">Update</span> button, your password will be reset.  If you forget your password, see the [Forgot Password](./account/signin#forgot-password) section.

  <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
  <img class="image-border" alt="change password" src="../../assets/images/change_password.png">
  </p>


### Notifications
<div class="accordion-bar">Notifications</div>
Currently, the only notification setting is <span class="form-label">Notify Me of Response Limits via Email</span>.  The default is 'on'.  When you purchase a Contest, there is a pre-defined number of responses (votes) and a timeframe associated with the Contest.  If you are getting more responses than you thought, you will get an email notification letting you know that you have run out of responses (number left is 0).  You can increase your limit by going to the <span class="inline-accordion">Pay and Launch</span> [section](./contests/pay_launch#purchase-question-and-answers) of the Contest Detail page.  Below is a sample where a new Answer was added **and** a Purchase Extension was chosen to add 5,000 responses and 2 more months.  

  <p align="center" class="screen-shot">
  <img class="image-border" alt="purchase extension" src="../../assets/images/purch_extension.png">
  </p>

In addition, you will get notifications for every 25% overage that you have.  So, if you initially paid for 1,000 responses and you now have 1,250 responses, you will get an email letting you know you are over your limit.  For every 25% over, you will get a new email until the campaign time runs out, or you pay for the overage.  Your contest will still be recording votes when you go over your response limit, however, you will not see them unless you go back to the [Pay and Launch](./contests/pay_launch#purchase-question-and-answers) section and purchase the overage responses by selecting <span class="form-label">Purchase Responses to Offset Overage of X Responses</span> - where X is the number of responses you are over.  You should try go guess accurately how many responses you will get, as the overage price is slightly more than if you had purchased enough responses in the beginning. Once you pay for the overage, your Responses will show up in your [Results](results).


### Billing
<div class="accordion-bar">Billing</div>
The Billing section will contain **all** of the transactions you have had.  They will be separated by Contest name and Questions.  You can see each transaction you have had for each Question.  The below summary shows that we paid for 1 Contest called **Chicken Contest** with 1 Question *Which chicken do you like better?*.  We purchased it on 3/22/2023 with 3 answers and 15,000 responses (remember this was a big contest at a rodeo).  Then, 2 days later we added an Answer (a new chicken) and paid for that.  The same day, we added 1,500 more responses because they sold out the rodeo and we thought we could use the padding.

### Terminate Service
<div class="accordion-bar">Terminate Service</div>
If you are finished using QR-Contest (we hope not), you may terminate your service in this section.

There are 2 options:

<span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle"></i></span> Cancel Service - disable and archive data

This option will mark all of your data as archived in our backend and remove your user account.  You may contact us at a later date to re-enable your account and data.  We will only hold onto your archived data for no more than 60 days.  After that, the data will be removed and we will be unable to restore it.

<span class="inline-icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle"></i></span> Delete Service - permanently remove data - cannot be undone

{: .warning }
> This is irreversible.  Once you select this option and choose <span class="inline-button">Update</span>, you will be prompted to make sure you are positive that's what you want to do.  If you respond Yes to terminate the service, your data is gone for ever and we will be unable to restore any of it.
